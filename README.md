## React App
This app was made with [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and maintains data integrity with the help of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

### About this app
An online red wine shop in which users can add wines to a shopping card.
The owner of the shop can log in with a github/twitter/anonymous account (OAuth) and can create/update/delete wines in real-time (firebase is a real-time database service).
